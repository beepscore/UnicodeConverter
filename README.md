# Purpose
Convert from UTF-8 to UTF-32 without using standard "Unicode conversion faculties".

# Results

## Problem statement
The task: implement a function that converts UTF-8 encoded string to UTF-32.
You cannot use any standard Unicode conversion faculties in your implementation.
The function will be a part of widely used utility library used in many contexts.
It is up to you to define the input and output data types and error handling semantics.
The code should be production quality and include tests.

## Assumptions
OK to use "standard unicode conversion faculties" to generate source UTF-8 string.
OK to use "standard unicode conversion faculties" to test other code.
Tests can get expected values by manually looking up some values.

## Plan
Start by using standard conversion methods to gain familiarity with API.
Then add custom methods.

### UTF-8

#### Generate a UTF-8 string
Use "standard unicode conversion faculties" to generate source UTF-8 string.
Write a method to convert NSString to NSData or array of UTF-8 encoded bytes.

#### Decode UTF-8 string to Unicode code points
Implement a custom decoder.
Test convert strings containing characters that convert to 1, 2, 3 and 4 byte lengths.

### UTF-32
Implement an encoder that converts Unicode code points to UTF-32.
In simplest encoding, start with all zeros, hex 00 00 00 00 and add unicode code point.

# Appendix Background

## UTF-8
Uses 1 to 4 bytes per code point.
Early decoders threw errors when given bad input, and malware exploited this
to create denial of service attacks.
If decoding fails, consider returning replacement character "ï¿½" (U+FFFD)

## UTF-32
Uses fixed length 4 bytes per code point.
UTF-32 may be big-endian UTF-32BE or little endian UTF-32LE.
In simplest encoding, start with all zeros, hex 00 00 00 00 and add unicode code point.
